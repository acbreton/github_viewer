# github_viewer
An AngularJS-based GitHub viewer using the GitHub API

Hi there. This is a project I started working on after watching Scott Allen's "AngularJS: Getting Started" course on PluralSight.  
Really cool course if you have a chance to check it out.

Plan is to keep building on the project and see what cool things I can do with the GitHub API.

Currently,  this app grabs a user from a search query to the GitHub API and consequently displays the repos that they are a part of.
After clicking on a given repo, the app displays who has contributed to the project.

Thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next update!
